# Localist

### Summary:
Localist is an easy-to-use recommendation generator built to make it easy to share your taste with friends and followers. 

I plug in to the Mapbox API for map rendering and for geocoding and autocomplete on the 'add a location' feature.

Instead of saving locations to your Mapbox account, this app gives you the opportunity to save your locations to a local MongoDB instance.
